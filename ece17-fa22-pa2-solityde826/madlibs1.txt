Espionage is the formal word for VERB. In the shadowy
world of spies, international organizations use ADJECTIVE
spies to infiltrate ADJECTIVE groups for purpose of obtaining
top-secret PLURALNOUN.

For example, spies might have to crack the code for accessing
ADJECTIVE files.  Sometimes the missions are far more
dangerous -- like stealing the key ingredient for making the award-winning
"Explosive FRUIT pie", invented by NAME.

Spies are found the world over in places like PLACE --
but they are not allowed to reveal their ADJECTIVE identities.
A spy may be anyone including celebrities like NAME, and even the
little old lady with COLOR hair and the pet ANIMAL.

The world of spying might seem glamorous and ADJECTIVE, but it's filled
with ADJECTIVE risks and ADJECTIVE rewards!  Sure, spies get to carry super-cool devices
like a NOUN, but they can't trust anyone. That's why the number
NUMBER rule for spies is -- "keep your PLURALNOUN close and your
PLURALNOUN closer!".
